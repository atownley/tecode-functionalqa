README for FunctionalQA
=======================

This is a basic library for performing functional testing of external
programs.  It is not a unit testing framework like Test::Unit or
JUnit, but is designed to test the functional characteristics of a
component from the outside.  This is often known as "black box" style
testing, where most unit testing is "white box" style.

The design of this framework is somewhat influenced by Segue Software's
functional testing tools, QA Partner and SilkTest, but only in the
high level concepts.  The last time I actually worked with these tools
was in 2000, so I'm sure the similarities are only superficial at
best.  Also, a lot of what's here has been influenced by earlier work
I did in providing an object-oriented implementation of the QA
Partner/SilkTest recovery system.  This work was originall presented
at the 1998 Segue User Conference, so it is not proprietary
information to either Segue or to Informix (now IBM) who was my
employer at this time.

To use this module, check it out somewhere and add this directory to
your RUBYLIB search path.  For examples (which don't rely on having
RUBYLIB set correctly), look in the demo directory.

NOTE:  As of 2005-09-26 this is still very much a work in progress.
